RDS : Relational Database Service : RDS supports 6 relational db engines.
--> Amazon Aurora : (postgresql / mysql compatable)
--> Mysql	: Mysql Workbench
--> MS Sql	: microsoft ssms (sql server management studio)
--> postgreSQL	: Pgadmin
--> Mariadb	: workbench
--> Oracle	: oracle tool, Toad

Heterogenious Migration : mariadb --> RDS --> SCP (Schema Convertion tool) --> mysql
Homogenious Migration :  mysql --> mysql

un : admin
pwd : Avinash123

Free tier : db.t2.micro

Storage : 20gb 
Storage autoscaling : storage adds automatically. (5 gb storage / 10% of existing storage)

mysql : 3306

AUtomatic Backups for RDS : Enable
--> AWS Creates backup copies automatically for the RDS instances.

Backup retention period : How many daya backup copies you want to hold/have in your account to restore.

Retention period : Default : 7 Days, Min : 1 Day, Max : 35 Days

_____________________________

--> We won't get any IP address for Database, We will get DB Endpoint. 


Free Tier : db.t2.micro , 750 Hrs/Month..

--> MultiAZ Deployment : No DOwntime required for our RDS instance, If our DB contains lot of sensitive information.
Creates a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ) to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups.


--> Read Replica : Whenever we are getting lot of read operations on our database and if we want to offload read operations from primary copy, We can enable read replicas.

	--> We can create Read replica in another Region also.
--> If required, we can promote read replica as individual db instance.
--> Once replication breakdown, we cannot re establish the connection.



Backup : 
--> System Backup / Automated Backup : 
	--> Managed by AWS.
	--> We cannot delete these Backups, If we delete RDS instance, these deletes automatically.
	--> We can reduse the backup retention period to reduse the backup copies count.

--> Manual Backup : Manually we can create a Snapshot.
	--> Manual snapshots, we need to delete. 


--> We can initiate a restoration in case of any db failure. Point-in-time copy option.
--> RDS won't use In-place restoration.  When we restore, we will get a new copy of the rds instance. 


Task : Launch RDS Instance and Create a Read replica. 

Task 2 : Create a Wordpress website. LAMP (Linux Apache Mysql Php)

wp-config.php under /var/www/html/		--> COpy the script and keep it.

Amazon Aurora db : 
--> Amazons own DB solutions. 
--> 2 compatable versions:
	--> Mysql Compatable  : mysql workbench
	--> postgreSQL compatable : pgadmin

--> Aurora database clusters with up to 128TB of storage. Remaining all DB supports only 16TB.
--> Aurora have Server version and Serverless version.
--> NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.

Serverless : You specify the minimum and maximum amount of resources needed, and Aurora scales the capacity based on database load. This is a good option for intermittent or unpredictable workloads.

Minimum and Maximum Aurora capacity unit	: 2gb ram, 256 gb max

____________________

Dynamodb : Serverless architecture : NoSQL Database service : Single digit millisecond latency at any scale.. IoT, Mobile gaming, adtec.. 
Latency : Response time

--> Choose how many read & write capacity units you required. We can enable Autoscaling also.

DAX : Dynamodb Accelerator : In-Memory caching solution for DynamoDB.. 

_________

RDS Caching Solution : ELasticache
--> Elasticache supports 2 caching engines
	--> MemcacheD
	--> Redis
_________
AWS Own Datawarehousing solution : RedShift

DMS : Database Migration Service : 

Homogenious Migration : Mysql (on-prem) --> DMS --> Mysql (rds)
HeteroGenious migration : IBM db2 (on-prem) --> SCT (Schema convertion tool) --> DMS --> Mysql (rds)

Security Services : 

CloudTrail : Logging service in AWS. It stores last 90 Days information by defaultly. We can create a trail to s3 to have logs for unlimited days. 

Management events : Capture management operations performed on your AWS resources.

Data events : Log the resource operations performed on or within a resource. 
S3, Dynamodb, Lambda

Insights events : Identify unusual activity, errors, or user behavior in your account.

___

Amazon Config : Works along with Cloudtrail. Inventory service in AWS. (COST US)
--> We can setup complinace standards for our resources.
--> We can even get resource timelime. 


No s3 bucket should be made public. : Non-Compliance Resouce.
Snapshot : Public --> RULE 

IAM User --> S3Readonly --> S3FullAccess.. --> AdminAccess
