RDS : Relational Database Service : RDS supports 6 relational db engines.
--> Amazon Aurora : (postgresql / mysql compatable)
--> Mysql	: Mysql Workbench
--> MS Sql	: microsoft ssms (sql server management studio)
--> postgreSQL	: Pgadmin
--> Mariadb	: workbench
--> Oracle	: oracle tool, Toad

Heterogenious Migration : mariadb --> RDS --> SCP (Schema Convertion tool) --> mysql
Homogenious Migration :  mysql --> mysql

Storage : 20gb 
Storage autoscaling : storage adds automatically. (5 gb storage / 10% of existing storage)

AUtomatic Backups for RDS : Enable
--> AWS Creates backup copies automatically for the RDS instances.

Backup retention period : How many daya backup copies you want to hold/have in your account to restore.

Retention period : Default : 7 Days, Min : 1 Day, Max : 35 Days

--> We won't get any IP address for Database, We will get DB Endpoint.

--> MultiAZ Deployment : No DOwntime required for our RDS instance, If our DB contains lot of sensitive information.
Creates a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ) to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups.


--> Read Replica : Whenever we are getting lot of read operations on our database and if we want to offload read operations from primary copy, We can enable read replicas.

	--> We can create Read replica in another Region also.
--> If required, we can promote read replica as individual db instance.
--> Once replication breakdown, we cannot re establish the connection.



Backup : 
--> System Backup / Automated Backup : 
	--> Managed by AWS.
	--> We cannot delete these Backups, If we delete RDS instance, these deletes automatically.
	--> We can reduse the backup retention period to reduse the backup copies count.

--> Manual Backup : Manually we can create a Snapshot.
	--> Manual snapshots, we need to delete. 


--> We can initiate a restoration in case of any db failure. Point-in-time copy option.
--> RDS won't use In-place restoration.  When we restore, we will get a new copy of the rds instance. 


Task : Launch RDS Instance and Create a Read replica. 

Task 2 : Create a Wordpress website. LAMP (Linux Apache Mysql Php)

wp-config.php under /var/www/html/		--> COpy the script and keep it.
